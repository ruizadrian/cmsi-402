## Unicat Escape

#### *Logo and Pictures Coming Soon*
### Description
* 2D Endless running game
* Unicorn Cat running away from hoomans that are trying to catch you because you are so rare!
* Powerups/Bad items you don't want to get
* Game to be compatible on Desktop & Mobile
* Compete and see who can last the longest time running away!

### Justification
* Although many similar games have been made, this will give me the experience to see what goes in to building a complete game/app
* Will have to learn more extended and complicated JavaScript uses
* Will have to implement a database
* Will have to get some animations/sprites and graphics

### User's POV
* Desktop & Mobile game will all look the same
* Desktop game will be used with either Space Bar for jumping or Mouse Left-Click
* On Mobile platforms you will just tap the screen
* Since it is an endless runner, the outcome of the game is to try to get the highest score possible to compete with other users

### Technologies
* Phaser.io
* JavaScript
* Intel XDK
* Cocoon.js
* Python
* Firebase
