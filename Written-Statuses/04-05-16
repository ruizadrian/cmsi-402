###Current Application Status

The current status of my application is that I still have some graphics that I need to work on, however, I have made a lot of progress on the rest of my application.
I have a somewhat working game, however, there are still a couple of bugs and therefore it is broken, but I am very close to the end. 
I need to make and/or get some audio pieces for my game, as I have implemented feature for there to be audio and therefore just need to get the actual audio files made.
In terms of the timeline and what is to come in the next couple of weeks, I am going to be getting my game up and running and finishing up with the graphics part.
I have a couple more things to draw up and create, but for the most part, I would say I am about 90% done.
